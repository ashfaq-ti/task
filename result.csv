C-1 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 1 of 23 Introduction The Innovation Working Group is a subcommittee of the International Bridge Turnpike and Tunnel Association (IBTTA) Emerging Technology Committee. Its charge is to identify strategies and provide guidance for organizations to build innovation capacity and to identify emerging technologies for the purpose of additional study. This white paper provides information on innovation practices and trends within the toll
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," industry and recommends areas for additional work. In 2019, t his working group published a whitepaper titled Strategies for Innovation and Technology , which offered guidance for organizations to increase their ability to innovate and provided a Technology and Innovation Matrix to identify and track emerging technologies . That guidance is predicated on the notion that achievement involves two inter connec ted and mutually reinforcing dimensions: building innovation capacity and engaging in regional collaboration. In the paper, a set of nine strategies was shared (see Table 1 and Appendix A). Table 1: Approaches for Cultivating Innovation by IBTTA Organizations Building Innovation Capacity Advancing Regional Collaboration 1. Leadership commitment 2. Chief Innovation Officer or team 3. Staffing and resource plan 4. Agile management processes 5. Future -focused technology plan 6. Flexible procurement and contracting 7. Data platform/sharing hubs 1.

aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," interoperability 2. Regional or State transportation innovation councils/task forces 3. Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) In this work, we assess the current state of practice within our industry for carrying out these strategies . Our industry scan included a survey and structured interviews with IBTTA member organizations . The results of the survey are compiled in Appendix B, and the structured interviews led to the development of 11 case studies captured in Appendix C. As indicated in the survey results , IBTTA member organizations are in different places when it comes to embracing and cultivating innovation or adopting emerging technologies. This is largely because i nnovation can have different meanings to different organizations depending upon their business needs and strategic goals. According to M erriam-Webster, innovation means “ the introduction of something new; a new idea, method, or device. ” Within our industry, it means updating operational and business processes for"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," efficienc y gains. I t also means enabling research and development to keep tolling relevant as transformational technology and mobility trends evolve. Regardless of each organization’s progress in building innovation capacity, this white paper can serve as a reference point or baseline of practice for organizations with an interest in innovation. Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 2 of 23 The industry scan results are documented in the next three sections of this white paper. The first section provides an overview of the state of the practice through seven broad observations , each of which is also accompanied by illustrative highlights of practice. The second section presents 11 case studies that showcase organizational approaches to cultivating innovation and/or technology initiatives. The third section introduces practices and tools that stood out as “game - changers” for advancing innovation programs and technology adoption. The final"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," section includes c onclusions and recommendations for building innovation capacity. State of Practice The transportation industry is complex and operates in a dynamic environment where the pace of change and opportunities for transformation is on the rise. Building capacity for innovation positions organizations to adapt in this changing environment ; the c osts of not doing so may be great. Our changing transportation landscape, driven largely by emerging technology and a rapidly evolving mobility ecosystem , has the potential to present competitive threats to the tolling industry . The se threats go beyond falling revenue, a s cited in the report, Guide to Creating and Sustaining a Culture of Innovation. 1 Today , the toll industry plays an essential role in helping to fund, deliver, and manage key mobility infrastructure . In this evolving environment, doing business as usual won’t work moving forward, particularly as agencies look to updating or replacing legacy technology and services . For example, the"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," need for emergency roadside phones fell by the wayside with the emergenc e of and widespread adoption of mobile phones. W hile dynamic messaging signage (DMS) is a prominent safety - and communication- technology in widespread use today, with the advent of connected and automated vehicles and C2VX (cellular vehicle- to-everything) enabling real -time communications with drivers, some organizations are rethinking future investments in DMS. The toll industry also needs to reconsider its role in the future mobility ecosystem by delivering services and products differently ; otherwise, t hey may see their role reconfigured, dimi nished, or perhaps become altogether irrelevant . Today’s roadways mostly enable people to go from point A directly to point B typically using one mode of travel. In the future, roadways will likely evolve into integrated mobility systems that support multi -modal tr ips from Point A to Point B and then to Point C with the ability to pay for the entire trip in one single transaction"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," (tolls, mode, parking and other fees) . The industry needs to be careful, selective, and strategic in decisions about investing in technology without a clear lifecycle and it also needs a seat at the table with regards to defining, preparing for, and delivering the mobility system of tomorrow. 1 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019.

Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 3 of 23 The toll industry is facing a grand opportunity to play a key role in shaping, direct ing and deliver ing the future mobility ecosystem ; being open to change and moving decisively is key. IBTTA member organizations are already moving in this direction. Historically, toll agencies rely heavily on technology for most if not all of its operations —from back office, payments and"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," collections, to traffic management, to customer service. M oving forward goes beyond an embracement of technology. This scan shows that organizations are increasingly adopting innovation as a strategy for embracing change and are creating a culture that speeds the rate at which relevant ideas , technologies, and opportunities are shar ed, accepted and put into practice. Building a culture of innovation can be challenging particularly in the public sector where a “we’ve always done it this way” mentality exists, and resources are limited and already stretched. Many organizations are overcoming this challenge and are making great strides in building their capacity for innovation. This section presents seven broad observations that were drawn from this industry scan: There’s not a “one size fits all” approach to innovation. Emerging technology is driving organizations to reconsider their approach to innovation. It is becoming increasingly “need -driven.” Organizations with successful programs have executive"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," leadership support and a formal commitment from leaders at all levels to make innovation a priority. Making innovation viable and sustainable requires embedding it into the organizational culture and within a structured environment. Data is a critical component of innovation programs; organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of data centralization (and data sharing) and the need for specialized staff t o support them. Innovative organizations recognize the need for physical infrastructure and/or cooperative partnerships to deploy productive demonstrations. Technology -driven innovation calls for flexible procurement processes. Each of these findings is briefly discussed below. For each, examples from peer organizations are provided. 1 3 4 5 6 2 7 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 4 of 23 There’s not a “one size fits all” approach to innovation. Organizations make the decision to innovate for purposes that are based on specific"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," needs and strategic priorities. In addition to the organization need, innovation programs may also be driven by consumer demand, operational needs or trends, and newly emerging technologies , policies and practices. Grounded in an understanding of need, innovation programs can vary widely across organizations, and over time, programs may adapt and evolve as needs shift . The best approach to encourage innovation will look significantly different from one organization to another depending on organizational structure, leadership vision and culture, history of innovation, priorities, financial position, and other factors. Building an innovation program should be considered as an iterative or evolving process. Waiting to “get it right” misses the point of innovation. Merely following another organization’s approach and f ailing to be open to different methods could result in limited outcomes or narrowed innovations. Many of the organizations included in this industry scan have modified the structures of their"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," innovation teams over time based on their shifting priorities and organizational climate, but also as their capacities and talent base grows. A key to successful innovation is being flexible and allowing programs to evolve over time . In a performance- driven environment where meeting goals and demonstrating tangible gains is paramount, this is a challenge many organizations face early in their innovation journey s. It takes a risk tolerant environment, an experiment al culture and dedicated resources and staff with a personal commitment to grow innovation right. Each organization will define its own unique program , develop tailored innovation practices, and try out a blend of different approaches to address their own circumstances . Highlights:  The North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA) previously had a consolidated formal innovation program, but they found that this approach actually stifled innovation due to increased bureaucracy. In response, NTTA decentralized the program by embedding innovation"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," initiatives into each individual department. This new approach decreases bureaucracy and allows each department to tailor innovation processes to their specific needs.  Conversely, t he Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) is in the process of centralizing their innovation program; what used to be known as the NG (or Next Generation) team is now the 3G (referring to the Third Generation toll system) team, and MDTA plans to transition this team into a new Office of Innovation that will collaborate across departments to roll out new technology solutions. 1 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 5 of 23 Emerging technology is driving organizations to reconsider their approach to innovation. It is becoming increasingly “need- driven.” Having been relatively stable for years, the tolling industry is poised for change with emerging technology as a driving force. Surviving in a rapidly changing environment demands new responses and ways of thinking."
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," Organizations are embracing innovation as one response to this pressure; they are using innovation to reframe their approach to the industry , and their roles within the industry . Along the way, they are discovering new ways to improve business processes, operations, and customer service. At the same time, innovation practitioners are adopting a new mindset when it comes to technology. Rather than view emerging technology as a “shiny new object” that might be fun to try out , they are first defining the problem or customer need and then seeking out the technology to best address es or solve the problem. Another mindset change that comes with technology adoption is associated with the “fail fast” approach to innovat ion. According to a 2018 Forbes Article2, repeating the fast failure approach helps organizations achieve a desired outcome faster than trying to perfect a product or service (and save money spent on custom ization or making adjustments in operations or internal processes to accommodate the"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," product or service). Rather, get a product or service out there, fail fast and learn from your mistakes , and quickly pivoting and getting a slightly different product or service to better suit the need. Finally , aligning innovation- related decision making with strategic priorities is becoming an essential practice . Resulting initiatives , including those involving emergi ng technology , are matched with a clear opportunit y to address a business, operational, or customer need. Highlights:  Both the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission (Ohio Turnpike) and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission ( PTC) have instituted i nnovation teams that encompass both business process improvements and technology as core focus areas . PTC’s council is established through formal policy to ensure its longevity within the organization.  ASFINAG has elevated Innovation as a core business strategy with six fields of action that include building a culture of innovation, adopting technology solutions, and creating"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," processes to ensure innovation is built into day -to-day business processes.  At NTTA , innovation projects are selected with the organization’s core mission in mind and are prioritized through negotiation across departmental leaders rather than a formal prioritization framework. As an example, information technology (IT) is one area where there are often competing needs across departments. To address issues across multiple departments, NTTA has set up an IT counsel to serve as a venue for prioritizing IT needs 2 See https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/04/30/how -to-fail-faster -and-why -you-should/?sh=b7b4e4cc1779 2 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 6 of 23 across the organization. As with other initiatives, elements that prioriti ze the agency’s core mission and goals are prioritized. All other IT needs are negotiated and distributed in turn to avoid some departments being favored over others.  Some organizations, such as the"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," Tampa- Hillsborough Expressway Authority ( THEA ), have approached innovation with a more technology -centric focus. They are exploring new connected corridor and connected vehicle technology solutions which align with strategic goals and objectives. Advising not to get too sold on one technology, THEA matches the technology to the need. They are on the third technology attempt related to pedestrian detection / crosswalk analytic s.  The E-470 Public Highway Authority (E -470) approached innovation from a business process perspective (e.g., they hired staff to manage and set up a process for innovation) and is using their established innovation process to garner new ideas and technology solutions. Organizations with successful programs have executive leadership support and a formal comm itment from leaders at all levels to make innovation a priority. One benefit of this industry scan was the opportunity to learn about what other organizations believe to be sound foundational strategies for innovation. Our"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," surveys and interviews demonstrated that the best starting point is to identify an “innovation owner” who has the highest level of interest (and ideally, funding authority ) to launch an innovation system or program that strategically aligns with business goals. Ideally, that person has the complete support of or is a member of the executive leadership team and can propel innovation forward so that it becomes an integral part of the organization’s culture, standard process, and/or everyday work. For innovation to take root within an organization, leaders at all levels must make a visible commitment to make innovation a priority . They also connect progress towards strategi c goals with the ability to innovate. The industry scan showed that innovation champions in the toll industry are typically an Executive Director or a senior officer (e.g., Deputy Executive Director, Chief Innovation Officer, Chief Information Officer or Chief Technology Officer) but they can also be individuals that work anywhere in the"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," organization including in director or senior management posi tions , line management roles, and other staff . The key is that they can shape or influence the core operations of an organization with a focus on supporting innovation. Within the tolling industry, commitment to innovation is often initiated and bolstered through the strategic planning process which is built around a mission, vision and core values which emphasize the importance of innovation. 3 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 7 of 23 Highlights:  In 2016, E -470’s Executive Director in partnership with the agency’s Board of Director s incorporated a Strategic Plan, mission and core values that support tec hnology and innovation objectives . Subsequent to the strategic plan, a structure was put into place t through the E -470 workplan which aligns projects with strategic goals and priorities. In 2019, the process was further strengthened by the establishment of an Enterprise"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," Project Management Office (ePMO) to create structure around project intake process. The ePMO is supported by a dedicated innovation team.  While the PTC does not have a formal program, innovation is one of the core tenets that underpin their strategic plan and values. The CEO is a major champion of innovation and his leadership ensures that a culture of innovation extends across the organization through inclusive initiatives such as their Innovation Council.  The State Road and Tollway Authority’s ( SRTA) Executive Director is a strong champion for innovation and is instrumental in ensuring it is part of the agency culture. As one of the agency’s five core v alues and with a dedicated position (director of innovation and strate gy) to make sure that innovation discussions happen across all departments and opportuniti es are aligned with strategic priorities , innovation has become embedded into the culture of the agency. Making innovation viable and sustainable requires embedding it into the organizational"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," culture, within a structured environment and with performance measures. Tolling organizations embrac e innovation as way to make meaningful changes in business practices and advanc e emerging technologies and mobility trends. However, even with a strong commitment to innovation, it is often conduc ted “ad hoc ” and without focus on building a culture or formal process(es) to support innovation. Without a culture to support innovation, employees can easily confuse innovation with concepts like creativity or change. The concept of change often evokes a wide range of feelings and interpretations ranging from creating an unacceptable exposure to risk or on a more personal level, threatening an employee’s (or department’s) function or workload. This can lead to the pursuit of “ opportunistic initiatives ” or those that arise through immediate circumstances or on the spur of the moment without reference to a strategic plan or vision. For example, workplace restrictions due to the COVID -19 pandemic may have"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," spurred the adoption of new or expansion of workplace collaboration t ools, policies and practices (e.g., Zoom and Microsoft Teams platforms, policies t o support electronic document approvals and signatures, and telecommuting policy. Opportunistic initiatives aren’t inherently wrong or a bad practice; however, innovation programs that rely heavily on them compromise the long- term sustainability and limit the benefit derived through innovation, thus undermining the intent behind 4 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 8 of 23 embracing it in the first place. Addressing this requires building a culture that supports innovation and includes the structure and resources to support it. Innovation also thrive s in a formal, well-structured and supportive environment . Such operating models often consist of a small central team who manage processes, act as an “innovation hub,” and help innovation advocates from different departments launch initiatives. D"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," edicated management, technical, and data analytics innovation staff with trusted access to systems and data will facilitate momentum for innovation. Typically, innovation can be frustrated or throttled due to dependence upon staff or systems that are focused on day to day operations. As such, the pace and benefits of i nnovation will likely be slowed or not fully realized. Another important component of a formal structure is measuring innovation performance. Doing so enables organizations to show that the time, all the activity, and all the capabilities being spent to push innovation is worth the time , effort and money spent. Doing so helps to justify and secure funding for continued program support or for testing and/or deploy ing an innovation or technology. For an organization producing products or services, measures migh t be gross margin, number of new patent s, or sales from new products or services . For public sector organizati ons, examples of measures could be “friction” (how easy is it to move an"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," idea from initial intake to final testing or deploy ing the idea) and “velocity” (the number of innovations that can be accomplished in a period of time). This scan indicate s this is an area in which tolling industry organizations could use additional guidance on or sharing of best practice. An emerging trend is the use of an ePMO to support innovation and technology programs. The concept is not dissimilar from program management for infrastructure programs or megaproject s. Infrastructure projects typically employ a management and technical team solely focused on the delivery of infrastructure improvements from concept through opening . Particularly among larger organizations interested in supporting innovation within departments and business units, we see the ePMO model enhanced by the adoption of larger cross - departmental innovation teams. These cross -cutting innovation teams enable “quick win” business or operations improvements and meet on a monthly or quarterly basis to share and celebrate"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," successes . Highlights:  E-470 has implemented an ePMO for innovation. The Illinois tollway is in the process of developing an ePMO to support back -end, business systems innovation.  The PTC considers innovation a part of every individual’s role, and a fundamental part of the agency’s culture. The agency’s cross -departmental Innovation Council was created through formal policy and now follows a regular cadence and is refreshed with a new internal chairperson every 2 years. It is the key mechanism for external vendors and business partners to present new technologies and products . Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 9 of 23  Instilling innovation into the culture of an organization begins with who they hire and how they build staff at SRTA. With innovation as a core value, they hire and staff with that in mind. Thinking outside of the box , questioning how things get done, and finding better ways to do things are encouraged at the onset of an"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," employee’ s tenure with the agency. Data is a critical element of innovation programs; organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of data centralization (and data sharing) and the need for specialized staff. The need for flexibility and ownership of data is becoming increasingly apparent in our industry. Strategic decisions regarding operational improvements and technology investments often depend on data analytics. The inability to easily access and analyze data can hinder the decision- making process. For example, w hile our el ectronic tolling systems generate a wealth of data, the data is frequently residing with an outside contractor , fragmented among multiple internal departments or lack an accessible user -friendly interface for running queries and conducting analytics . Often , data that is later required to meet a business need is not anticipated at the time of procurement, so contracts are not written to give the agency access to data in a convenient way . Throughout this"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," assessment, the following observations were frequently overheard: “There’s a lot of data being collected, and it is not always readily available for analysis or use.” And “Data is often in the hand of the integrator —it often takes too long to access , contracts do not specify the task of manipulating and pushing data forward.” Financial systems also have data challenges —not all are tracked using a modern approach and business is focused on operations (e.g., tag fulfillment and revenue generation) and less so on reporting or business analytics solutions. Finally, having access to data is not of much value without the staffing , resources or an organized plan to use the data . A challenge to organizations is to demonstrate the rate of return for a data pl atform investment —how much they are willing to expend for the ROI return (e.g., quicker analytics). Consolidating data into a central, accessible database has been given a high priority among many innovation programs. Tolling organizations are starting to"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," implement internal data platforms designed to consolidate disparate data and provide convenient agency -wide access for analysis and potential dissemination to the public . Technology solutions frequently come with new data needs; they require specific data inputs, and they also generate new datasets of their own. Organizations that get ahead of these developments by hiring specialized staff and establishing adaptable data pl atforms make it easier to test and implement emerging technologies. But, doing it right requires awareness of needs. 5 Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 10 of 23 In determining needs, organizations need to recognize the importance of both business and functional expertise. For example, as shared by Deloitte:3 “A properly staffed data initiative may include design-thinking skills to help conceptualize a solution, functional domain knowledge to help identify high- value use cases and shape the solution, business skills to"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," articulate a compelling business case, data engineering skills to provide access to the right data in the form needed, and, for Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects, AI skills to drive execution of a variety of AI technologies. Success depends on more than technology talent—it requir es the right mix of skills and expertise.” Tolling organizations shared insights on their interests and resources related to data in the industry scan survey. When asked about the types of data science disciplines their organizations are investing, the vas t majority of respondents (90%) indicated “data analysis.” But they also recognize the need for more advanced disciplines requiring predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and AI (69%, 59%, and 31%, respectively) . And, given the importance survey respondents placed on data analysis as a priority discipline, it’s not surprising that nearly all organizations (96%) say they have hired one or more data analyst. See Figure 1 below . Figure 1: Data -related Disciplines Figure"

Highlights:  The Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority’s (CTRMA) toll and ITS project
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," host server is currently operated by the agency’s toll system integ rator with data analytic functions primarily handled by outside consultants . For data analytics, Tableau is used to create performance and operations dashboards . CTRMA’s ability to analyze data and advance data- driven projects is constrained by dependence upon the toll system integrator’s data platform that requires spec ialized management skills . CTRMA is actively pursuing development of an internal consolidated data solution that pulls in information such as transaction and customer data as well as roadway operation and performance information. This new platform will allow the Authority to manage and process data more efficiently and evaluate the information in a more int elligent manner. Consultant resources will be used for more complex data analytic efforts at least until after the new system is operational .  At SRTA, the innovation staff are keepers of the data. They have found that the ability to easily access and manipulate"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," their data makes them better positioned to address operational and business deficiencies.

Innovative organizations recognize the need for physical infrastructure and/or cooperative partnerships to deploy productive pilot d emonstrations. The ability to test new technologies in real -world settings is a contributing driver of innovation . When testing capabilities are limited by the lack of suitable roadside infrastructure, legal barriers, or political opposition, the pace of technological innovation can slow down .

As “real -world” testing of emerging technology progresses, developers are encountering unexpected challenges and complex challenges . For example, t he ITS JPO conducted a review of the Tampa Hillsborough Express way Authority Connected Vehicle Pilot and found that “the complexities of field testing and technology integration were significantly underestimated”.5 While this is not the case for every joint venture or partnership, public and private sector collaborators should be prepared for unexpected challenges and difficulties.

This is particularly true for public organizations. The traditional procurement process can be time consuming and is often predicated on competition among various vendors. Innovative technologies are often sole source with limited competition or"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," unique business models that are distinct from competitors. D esigning a procurement to specifically accommodate a particular technology provider can be viewed as anti -competitive and in some cases can be outright prohibited. Some organizations may have an option for sole source procurement, but that process can be plagued by bureaucratic processes that require extensive justification for pursuing a non- competitive approach. Regardless, these limitations can make pursuing technology driven pilot projects a hassle that discourages innovation within organizations. On the flip side, businesses and organizations seeking to provide innovative solutions face their own barriers associated with traditional procurement practices . For instance, t o demonstrate t he value of their solutions to agencies, they mus t often share proprietary information and risk that their information could become public record (due to open records and freedom of information policies).

While existing government procurement systems may appear to limit the spirit of innovation, a few public organizations ( THEA and Pennsylvania Turnpike) have pragmatic policies that enable agencies to use non- traditional procurement processes to engage in low -cost technology and innovation demonstrations . Meanwhile, others are seeking either internal or even legislative changes as to how they approach procuring new cutting -edge technologies . There are a number of ways public agencies are deliver ing innovation through existing rules using flexible procurement processes . These include applying Request for Information (R FIs) and industry forums and technology summits for early market engagement , unsolicited proposal policies, cooperative purchasing, and no- cost demonstration and innovation partnerships .

They also integrated innovation into their procurement to build their back office environment by breaking down the process into separate modules , allowing vendors to target and fit their product or service offering to a specific module, limiting the need for customization which adds cost and time to the process. Profiles of Innovation An objective of this white paper was to document specific cases of practice as different examples of organizations with active innovation programs or initiatives.

Still, it’s worth taking a moment to reflect amid the chaos on the progress being made by tolling organizations as an industry and individually in carrying out innovation strategies. That’s one of the values of this paper – the previous sections document progress, challenges, and many “wins” by peer member organizations."

For some organizations, getting to this point has meant breaking new ground, while for others it has meant maintaining a delicate balance of activities, strategic focus, and partnerships. Before jump ing to recommendations and next steps, this section takes one last moment for introspection. In 2019, this working group was concerned primarily with a set of basic strat egies for jumpstarting organizational readiness for innovation and setting up a foundation for monitoring and tracking emerging technology. This year, in our assessment of practice, peer Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 17 of 23 organizations shared what they are doing and how it’s working out.

COVID -19 Resiliency Since the start of the COVID -19 pandemic in Spring 2020, organizations have entered into a cycle of uncertainty in which shutdown orders and a reliance on remote work (e.g., telecommuting and flex work) has greatly impacted travel and commute behaviors. As a result, transportation agencies, including toll organizations, have experienced impacts on operations and customer service, and reduced revenue and budgets. With the future of the pandemic remaining unclear, the tolling industry will likely continue to face uncert ain times. According to Gartner research, top technology trends are those that enable “organizational agility” (the ability to adapt and respond to changes in external market conditions) ; as organizations emerge from the pandemic, they will very likely mov e forward on a different trajectory rather than returning to the previous status quo.6 In addition to organizational agility, Luxe research cites"

In this challenging environment, organi zations with investments in innovation may be positioned to evolve in a crisis situation. Other organizations at the nascent stage of innovation may have been thrust into an innovation mode quite unexpectedly. Moving forward, once the pandemic has passed, it may be worthwhile to reflect upon to what extent it may have impacted or influenced the toll industr y’s innovation capabilities by asking Did the pandemic jumpstart, speed up or delay , or otherwise limit innovation or technology initiatives?

With the traditional process, a Request for Proposal (RFP) outlines the goods and/or services needed and includes a"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," generalized scope of work for the desired approach and deliverables. Vendors prepare a response in a given timeline that best meets the needs of the agency as defined in the scope of work. The agency then selects the “most responsive” vendor in accordance with a set of predefined criteria. While the traditional RFP method works well to meet agency needs with well -defined s olutions, it can limit an agency’s ability to solicit a broad spectrum of innovative solutions from the private sector in response to a specific need. To provide flexibility and encourage innovation, many agencies have implemented additional methods “upstr eam” of the RFP process to first convey needs – rather than solutions – to the private sector.8 In this age of rapid technology development, these upstream approaches have grown in popularity as a means for obtaining fresh and innovative ideas and technology solutions to meet stated needs or strategic objectives. Organizations can then apply the information gleaned from the submittals"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," as the basis for a full open and competitive solicitation. These approaches do not replace or sidestep traditional procurement policy; rather, they help agencies gather ideas and solutions that will either inform future RFPs or be more suited for an alternative procurement method, such as a sole source award. These idea intake methods – including Unsolicited Proposal policies, innovation challenges, Requests for Information (RFIs), and no- cost or low -cost Demonstration Proposals – allow organizations to learn about new ideas and technology solutions based on stated needs or strategic objectives. The best method for an agency to use will depend on the nature and scale of the need being met, the level of specificity that is already known about potential solutions, and existing partnerships with accelerators or private sponsors that the agency can leverage. Each of these methods is briefly described as follows: 1. Unsolicited Proposals (U P). A way for government agencies to obtai n new or innovative ideas ,"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," methods, approaches, and technologies to accomplish its mission or address a specific need. UPs are written proposals that are submitted for the purpose of obtaining an award with the government and are not in response to a formal or informal request other than a general statement of needs publicized by the agency. Generally, the proposal must be innovati ve and unique; be independently originated and developed by the offeror ; 8 For the purpose of this section, “private sector” encompasses a range of organizations including private companies, startups and accelerators, universities and university researc h centers, and not -for-profits). Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 19 of 23 and include sufficient detail to permit a determination that government support could be worthwhile , and the proposed work could benefit the government organization.  Examples of agencies with established UP policies include: the Colorado High Performance"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," Transportation Enterprise (HPTE), the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA), and E -470 in Denver.  To help guide proposals so that they meet an agency need, some agencies publish “problem statements” or “challenge statements.” These statements s erve to communicate the agency’s pain points to the private sector, who can respond with unsolicited proposals in the hopes of receiving a sole source award or persuading the agency to issue a competitive RFP based on their proposed solution. LA Metro has even held Unsolicited Proposal Forums (also known as the Metro Accelerator Series) to foster dialogue with the private sector and improve the quality and relevance of proposals.  The majority of UP policies include two phases: vendors submit a Phase 1 proposal, and if the agency wants to know more about the solution, they request a more detailed Phase 2 proposal for evaluation.  Online platforms such as Submittable, Evalato, or Award Force are available to help collect, screen, evaluate, and manage"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," expressions of interest from prospective vendors. These platforms allow multiple judges to review submissions and communicate with submitters and other judges as needed. 2. Innovation Challenges. Innovation challenges are another way for agencies to generate interest and gain a broad range of innovative ideas from the private sector in a specific category, such as equitable mobility or clean energy. Winners are generally awarded a set amount of money to implement a pilot project. Challenges can help agencies establish partnerships with think tanks or start -up accelerators. Funding for challenges can come from a combination of public and private sponsors, as evidenced by the following examples:  USDOT Smart City Challenge9  Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge10  City One Challenge in Austin, TX11  i77 Partners Innovation Challenge Competition 9 https://www.transportation.gov/smartcity 10 https://www.bloomberg.org/program/environment/climatechallenge/ ; https://austintexas.gov/news/mike -bloomberg"

Request for Information (RFI) . RFIs are used to gain general information about potential vendors and the products and services they offer. The ultimate goal of sending an RFI is to see how a potential supplier’s products and services can best be used to solve solutions and fit business needs. RFIs are useful for understanding what each company has to offer and evaluating each company’s ability to meet the stated need. For instance, Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise issued an RFI for its back -office SunPass system in 2019,12 and SRTA in Georgia issued an RFI in 2020 for firms specializing in transit operations and maintenance13. 4. No-Cost or Low -cost Demonstration Proposal (DP) . DPs (also known as “Proof"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," of Concepts”) are often used to pilot technologies or systems. Because there are de minimis or no cost involved with the DP, there is no need for a formal procurement process and a project agreement usually suffices. However, DPs are mutually beneficial to vendors and agencies; the agency receives information about potential solutions at no cost (apart from staff time to implement, etc.), and the vendor has the opportunity to test solutions in a real-world environment, es sentially as a beta- test. An example of an DP is the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority’s demonstration partnership with Kapsch TrafficCom and Ford Motor Company to develop capabilities for connected vehicles to provide real - time toll rates, confirm toll payment, and offer a wider range of payment options. Moving forward, as the toll industry ’s innovation efforts mature and pursuits of emerging technologies grow, organizations will become increasingly exposed t o and experienced with flexible procurement processes . The sharing"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," of experiences, lessons learned, and sample materials such as partnership agreements and RFI and other templates will be of mutual benefit to both public and private sector organizations . Tools and Resources to Support I nnovation and T echnology Planning A successful innovation program helps organizations chart a path for adoption of new technologies, processes, and programs that are aligned with business strategy and the technology landscape. With new ideas and technology being introduced on a fast pace, a challenge lies in managing and sorting through the plethora of information, webinar invitations and industry news regarding emerging technology , business process innovations, and industry trends that bombards inboxes on a daily basis.

Among those that do have designated staff or departments shared they have also dedicated an executive or senior manager at this position. Despite this, innovation and data analytics is largely under -resourced in both staffing and budget allocations, and as a result, efforts are largely ad hoc.

This norm limits the amount of information sharing going on to formal groups and people who know each other. During the course of this assessment, discussions arose across both public and private sector organizations about the lack of, need for , and value of establishing a central repository or digital communications exchange venue that builds awareness of which agencies are working on what and on advancements in emerging technologies . Recommendations Given the trends and observations resulting from this scan, the following recommendations are offered for consideration by IBTTA and organizations . 1.

Facilitate information sharing and b est practices using:  Develop a system or expand the capabilities of IBTTA’s “The Exchange” and TOLLMINER™ to enable a digital forum (e.g., see SAE Forum) for innovation, emerging technology, demonstration, and testing projects . This might be accomplished through IBTTA and/or a sponsor organization to incorporate an interactive “Innovation and Technology Map” like Figure 3 in this paper .  Establish a peer exchange for innovation and e merging technology (modeled after AASHTO: https://research.transportation.org/peer -exchange- program/ ). This Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends 23 of 23 might be accomplished through IBTTA’s “Peer Exchange” and/or in partnership with an organization.

Out of that vision, he created a strategic plan with core values that could support innovation within the organization. The current E -470 Workplan was established based upon the s trategic goals and priorities laid out in the plan. By 2019, E -470 began to really address innovation through the development of an Enterprise Project Management Office (ePMO). This top down approach supports a culture and creates a structure for innovati on across the organization. The ePMO creates a landing spot for innovative projects and ideas, so the agency can stay on top of what is happening in the industry. Initially, ideas would come to the agency in a way that was overwhelming. As a result, a revi ew committee was established by the end of 2019, and a formal prioritization process for innovation was launched.

Investments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and other technological innovations are mainly addressed through coordination with the organization’s Information Technology Department. Approach to Innovati on NTTA previously had a formal innovation program, however, that program is no longer in place. Innovation within the organization was found to be more organic within each area, and the centralization of innovation as a function created more bureaucracy than required. Instead, the organization now embeds innovation within the core business functions of each individual business area. NTTA encourages all departments to innovate, and to find ways to improve all aspects of their everyday work. Each department is responsible for coming up with, tracking, and funding initiatives. Initiatives are only elevated to a higher level of corporate"

In essence, the innovation process is tailored by each department for each department to match specific needs. Where possible, NTTA has also strived to frame innovation in more approachable ways for staff across the organization. Rather than focus on innovation, they prioritize improving work processes. This has been helpful in keeping staff at all levels engaged, including those who may not perceive innovation as their strength. Management within NTTA also communicate with staff consistently to seek input and identify opportuni ties for improvement. The lack of a formal innovation evaluation process also ensures that no idea is left unheard. Their approach encourages the submittal and consideration of ideas , rather than setting procedural hoops for employees to jump through. Ins tead of paperwork and procedure, NTTA has opted for frequent communication between staff and leadership. With over 700 staff"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," across the organization, their moderate size has afforded them the flexibility to be nimble and respond quickly to evolving needs w ithin the organization.

Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends C-8 Initiative Highlights  Data and Analytics . NTTA o perates a mature business intelligence program that is focused on revenue assurance and business operations improvements . NTTA ’s program is supported by a team of dedicated analysts and an agency managed data platform with a level of access to the data. There are currently no plans to establish a regional data sharing system that shares traffic and other information.  Unsolicited Proposals . In addressing pressures for innovation from external sources, such as vendors and business par tners who present NTTA with unsolicited proposals,"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," NTTA has adopted a similar approach. The organization’s core mission and goals remain the ultimate test for whether an idea should be pursued. For example, in considering emerging vehicle technologies, suc h as connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), NTTA does not strive to be the first to allow vehicles to operate automated vehicles on their facilities, but rather seeks to explore connected capabilities further as it aligns with their core mission for ensuring s afety on their facilities. Though they do not reject unsolicited proposals, they do provide suggestions to external vendors and business partners on how to adapt concepts to better serve NTTA’s needs and meet its core mission.

While there is no formal evaluation process, each task team considers the initiatives they come up with against the Strategic Directives, objectives, and key results set out for the organization, and also consider the return on investment for each initiative through research. Issues that cannot be addressed through the task teams are elevated to the Executive Directors for further consideration. As the innovation program is still in its first year, funding was not set aside specifically for the initiatives set out this year. However, beginning with OTIC’s 2020 budget is expected to include resourcing for task team initiatives. An additional amount of contingency funding will also be set Emerging Technologies Committee Building Innovat ion Capacity : Toll Industry Practice And Trends C-10 aside to account for unexpected initiatives that arise beyond what is accounted for within the task teams.

PTC was awarded the 2019 Toll Excellence Award for Technology by the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA) for the development of a suite of web-based applications that allow duty offi cers to respond proactively to situations that arise, and to help maintain traffic flow more effectively across the turnpike facilities. Approach to Innovation PTC does not have a formal innovation program, but innovation is one of the core tenets that underpin their strategic plan and values. The organization considers innovation a part of every individual’s role, and a fundamental part of the agency’s culture. Innovation is focused from the top down, through the CEO, and permeates across the organization through inclusive initiatives such as their Innovation Council. The Innovation Council was created"
aebbed60-9d6d-4fd8-b4c2-ce747a609d26," through formal policy. Established approximately 6 years ago, it now follows a regular cadence, and is refreshed with a new internal chairperson every 2 yea rs. Originally developed as a venue to invite external business partners to come in and share new innovations, the Council now has a much broader mandate, bringing together about 40 people from across the organization on a regular basis to learn about and discuss innovative initiatives. The CEO is a major champion of the Innovation Council and makes an effort to attend each one and join in on the discussion. External vendors, business partners, and stakeholders are often invited to join council meetings as well. The Innovation Council is the key mechanism for external vendors and business partners to present on new technologies and products.

The costs of toll collection on many existing toll roads exceed 10% of revenues even if all tolls are collected electronically, not including the cost of toll collection infrastructure. This compares unfavorably to the cost of collecting the existing federal motor fuels tax, estimated to be less than 1% of revenues. In addition, m any roads may not have sufficient traffic willing to pay a high enough toll to fully cover financing, construction, maintenance, and toll collection costs. Due to these factors, as well as their political unpopularity, tolls are likely to play a limited role in funding surface transportation projects in the near future. Beyond a requirement that toll rates on bridges “shall be just and reasonable” and a provision limiting tolls on over -the-road buses, current federal law provides no role for the federal government in regulating toll rates or practices.

The vast majority of existing federally assisted roads, bridges , and tunnels may be converted to toll facilities but must meet reconstruction or replacement requirements.

T his report explains current federal policies governing tolling and discusses issues related to increasing the use of tolls as a source of revenue for surface transportation projects. A Brief History of Tolling on Federal Roads In some states, mostly in the Northeast and the mid -Atlantic region, many of today’s highways were originally toll roads, often built and operated by private investors. While"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," tolling often made it possible to build or improve roads at mini mal cost to taxpayers, many of these roads failed due to overly optimistic revenue expectations, inability to attract sufficient investment to pay for improvements, competing capacity, and toll avoidance and the related cost of enforcement.2 Over time, toll roads came to be regarded as obstacles to the free flow of commerce. When it established the forerunner of today’s federal -aid highway program in 1916, Congress emphasized the principle that roads should be free. Section 1 of t he Federal -Aid Road Act (39 Stat. 355) provided that “all roads constructed under the provision of this Act be free from tolls of all kinds.”3 The Oldfield Act of 1927 (44 Stat. 1398) opened the door to tolls by permitting the use of federal funds to build toll bridges as long as they were operated by the states or their political subdivisions.4 However, the federal Bureau of Public Roads continued to oppose the use of federal funds on toll roads.

These are largely off-system bridges that benefited from former federal bridge program and other off -system bridge spending . The decision to convert a free facility to a tolled facility must be made prior to completion of the qualifying reconstruction project. According to FHWA, once physical construction is comp leted , it is too late to make the decision to toll, unless an additional qualifying reconstruction or rehabilitation project is undertaken. The earliest that toll collection may be initiated is when the contract has been awarded for the physical constructi on activities that render the facility eligible for conversion to a toll facility. The only way"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," that an existing toll -free federal -aid highway may be converted without being reconstructed or replaced is if the conversion occurs under the Value Pricing Pilo t Program .12 HOV/HOT Lane Program: Section 166 Under 23 U.S.C.

The tolls must be collected electronically and must be variably priced to manage travel demand to help prevent degradation of the facility’s performance . The Setting of T oll Rates FHWA does not regulate the toll rates users pay on toll roads. Setting toll rates is the responsibility of the toll road owner or operator of the facility.

Financial Realities of Toll Roads Whether it is built or operated by a government agency or by private investors, a toll road must have sufficient traffic willing to pay a high enough toll to cover construction, maintenance, and toll collection costs if it is to be financially successful. Most roads on the federal -aid system are not likely to pass that test. In rural areas, highways often do not have enough traffic to cover the cost of building toll -collection infrastructure and collecting tolls.

Other public toll facilities, however, have struggled. One recent example is the 8 miles of express toll l anes built by the Maryland Transportation Authority on I -95 north of Baltimore. In the early months following their opening in December 2014, the toll lane revenue was less than expected, and although it has grown , the tolls still produced only $11 million in gross revenue in the year to June 2016 , far from enough to cover the cost of financing the $1.1 billion project.14 14 Maryland Transportation Authority, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (continued...)

The Pocahontas Parkway, an 8.8 -mile-long toll road near Richmond , VA, which opened in 2002, has persistently been unable to service debt due to low traffic volumes; in June 2012, its private opera tor wrote off the entire value of its investment in a 99 -year concession, and eventually transferred the lease to a new operator.15 SH-130, a 90 -mile, four -lane toll road near Austin, TX, has had much lower traffic volumes than forecast when it opened in 20 12, and the Texas Department of Transportation ended up subsidizing truck tolls in an effort to help make the privately owned project viable.

Their widely publicized difficulties have made investors more cautious about projects reliant on toll revenue. In some cases, private -sector in vestors have conditioned their participation in P3s on “availability payments,” regular payments from the sponsoring government entity to the private entity. This reduces the risk to the private entity, but leaves the public entity at risk if toll revenue falls short of expectations.17 Billing and Operating Costs Using tolls to support transportation expenditures may be a comparatively inefficient form of funding because of high administrative costs. Collecting federal motor fuels taxes is estimated to cost less than 1% of the amount collected.18 The process is administratively simple, because nearly all the federal fuels taxes are collected at the terminal “rack” from only 850 registered taxpayers nationwide, rather than at a large number of retail gasoline s tations.

In principle, the cost of operating an electronic tolling system should be much lower than the cost of manual collection, due to obvious personnel sa vings. However, many toll facilities continue to employ collectors to receive cash tolls. Those with no provision for collecting cash tolls normally bill drivers without transponders by mail at the address associated with the license plate on the vehicle, often at a higher rate to cover the cost of mailing the bill.

While the amount of toll revenue has grown significantly in recent years, toll revenue as a share of total spending on highways has been relative ly steady for more than half a century, in the range of roughly 5% to 6%.21 On average, facility owners collected $2.36 million per mile of toll road or bridge in FY2014, but revenue per mile varies greatly among facilities.22 All revenue from tolls flows to the state or local agencies or private entities that operate tolled facilities; the federal government does not receive any revenue from tolls. However, a major expansion of tolling might reduce the demand for federal expenditures on roads. There are thre e possible means of increasing revenue from tolling:  Increase the extent of toll roads.

Toll -road mileage comprises only 0.6% of the 1,0 22,567 miles of publi c roads eligible for federal highway aid.25 While there may be many existing roads on which tolling would be financially feasible, proposals to place tolls on existing roads have encountered strong opposition in several states, including Missouri, North Car olina, Texas, and Virginia.  Increase toll -road usage . In the aftermath of the recession that began in 2007, the number of vehicle miles traveled in the United States fell below prerecession levels until 2014.26 Vehicle miles traveled increased by 3.5% in 2015 and again by 2.8% in 2016.27 Vehicle miles traveled per capita have also increased, by 2.7% in 2015 and by 2.1% in 2016.28 If this trend continues , it bodes well for toll revenues , which would rise with increasing traffic. On the other hand, if long - term demographic trends and"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," social changes, such as the increased popularity of center -city living , eventually lead to slower growth in per sonal motor vehicle use, then toll revenues may be constrained in the longer term . The most obvious way to increase toll road use is to lower the rates. However, for this strategy to work, the increase in net revenue from the increased use would have to exceed the aggregate revenue lost because of the lower rates per user.  Increase the average toll per mile. Toll rates are o ften significant political issues at the state and local levels, especially when toll revenue is used for purposes other than building and maintaining the toll facility. Trucking interests frequently raise opposition to rate changes that increase truck tol ls relative to automobile tolls. On publicly owned facilities, political concerns may lead to toll reductions, as occurred on bridges operated by the Delaware River Port Authority and the Maryland Transportation Authority in 2015. Where roads are operated by private"

Further, some"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," states, particularly those with low population densities, may have few or no facilities suitable for tolling. Tolls may be an effective way of financing specific facilities, especially major roads, bridges, or tunnels that are likely to be used heavily and are located such that the tolls are difficult to evade, but they seem likely to be less effective in providing broad financial support for surface transportation programs. Proposals to encourage toll-like user charges on road or bridge networks raise issues that differ from those affecting single fac ilities. Networking toll facilities can have advantages of scale and allow for facilities with excess cash flow to cross -subsidize parts of the network that may not have sufficient traffic to be self -sustaining . Tolling the Interstate Highway System By mil eage, roughly 60% of the toll roads, bridges, and tunnels in the United States are on the Interstate System. Facilitating an increase in tolled Interstate System mileage (or even tolling the Interstate"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," System as a network ) has been the major issue in feder al tolling policy in recent years. According to FHWA figures, from 1990 to 2015 nearly 750 miles of Interstate highways, bridges , and tunnels were built as or converted to toll roads.30 This represents 64% of the increase in toll road mileage over that period. The federal restrictions on tolling the Interstate System have been substantially reduced since 1992. The main remaining restriction is the requirement t hat the existing free -lane count on surface Interstate highway s must remain the same, even if reconstructed. Thus, it does not appear that federal restrictions on tolling are the reason that only a small number of federal -aid highways, bridges , and tunnels have been converted to tol l facilities. Creating an Interstate Toll Network via the Reconstruction Process One option for expanding tolling on the Interstates would be for Congress to require tolling as Interstate System roads and bridges are rebuilt with reduced federal participation ."
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," As many of these roads are not in need of near -term reconstruction, the evolving Interstate System toll network would expand over many years, and t he corresponding reduction in federal -aid highway program spending would also be gradual. To a ccelerate the conversion, bonds might be issued to fund construction costs up front, with toll revenues from the newly rebuilt facilities then used to pay for the interest and bond retirement costs. Eventually the reconstructed facilities might coalesce in to a nationwide per-mile toll network.31 The eventual transition could require legal changes at both the state and federal level s, and there could continue to be resistance at both the national and local levels to the widespread expansion of tolling. 30 Federal Highway Administration, “Table HF -10 toll revenues from all units of government” and “Toll Mileage Trends: 2005 -2015,” in Toll Facilities of the United States.

Tolling U.S. Highways and Bridges Congressional Research Service 11 Converting the Entire Interstate System to a Toll Network One way of estimating the revenue that could be raised by tolling the entire Interstate System is to assume that the public would pay the same average annual amount per mile, $2.35 million, as is raised on existing U.S. toll roads and bridges. In this case, tolling all Interstate highways would be expected to raise roughly $112 billion per year. Of this, approximately $8 billion is already captured by existing toll facilities, leaving around $104 bil lion of new revenue. This might be more than enough to maintain and operate the proposed Interstate System"

However, this amount would represent a much large r financial burden on Interstate users than they currently bear in the form of motor f uels taxes . However, many portions of the Interstate System would probably not be able to generate this amount of revenue per mile. A large proportion of current toll revenue is collected on heavily traveled roads and bridges in urban areas. The rural segments that account for a majority of Interstate System mileage carry far less traffic. A Transportation Research Board (TRB) report prepared in 2007 for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program estimated that about 21% of the 28,990 miles of rural Interstate highways had the potential to be viable as toll roads .32 In cases where an Interstate carries little traffic, the costs of building and maintaining the toll collection system might be large relative to the revenue that could be realized , and it might be necessary to set tolls on heavily traveled road segment s high enough to provide cross"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," -subsidies to the operation, maintenance , and eventual reconstruction of low-traffic rural routes. In recent years, federal funds obligated for projects on the Interstate System have accounted for 27% to 32% of total annual federal -aid highway obligations, or about $11 billion to $12 billion annually (in 2014 dollars).33 Hypothetically, if all Interstate highways could be instantly converted to a self -sustaining t oll network and received no further federal funding, expenditures under the remaining federal -aid highway program would fall from an average of about $4 5 billion per year to around $33 billion. This would bring federal highway program spending in line with the motor fuel s tax revenues that provide the main support for the Highway Trust Fund.34 This assumes, however, that drivers would continue to pay federal motor fuels taxes for fuel used while driving on toll roads that do not receive federal funds. Converting Urban Interstates to Toll Networks A less ambitious alternative would be to"

Approximately 8% of the roughly 18,500 miles of urban Interstate highways are tolled already, leaving over 17,000 miles of road available for c onversion to toll roads. Assuming tolls would be imposed at rates that generate the current average of $2.35 million per mile, tolling the currently free urban Interstates might produce nearly $40 billion in annual revenue, nearly as much as the highway ac count of the HTF now receives from motor fuels taxes. However, it is doubtful that such a large sum could be realized once operating , collection , enforcement , and financing costs are covered across the urban areas .

Conversion Costs Costs of establishing tolling across the Interstate System are likely to be great. States would need to con struct gantries above roads and entrance and exit ramps at thousands of locations to hold toll-collection equipment and cameras to identify toll violators, in addition to building communications infrastructure. If tolling were introduced in conjunction wit h reconstruction of Interstate highway segments, estimates of the road -building costs involved range from $1 trillion to $3 trillion.36 The use of bond financing would add interest expense.

Increased use of tolling would therefore be unlikely to have a significant impact on the need for taxpayer funding over a 10- or 15 -year time frame. Increased Use of Tolling to Encourage Innovative Finance The revenue stream provided by tolling can be used to support highway projects that rely on debt finance and private equity investment, both of which have long histories in toll road construction. In recent years, Congress has encouraged the use of innovative financing mechanisms such as P3s, which may use toll revenues in several ways.  Toll revenues can be used to service municipal bonds that state and local agencies have issued to pay for highway projects. The federal government supports this spending by providing a tax exclusion of the interest paid on the bonds. The tax exclusion results in a loss of revenue to the federal government. Private"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," activity bonds, in which a state or local government acts as a financial conduit for a business or individual (such as a P3), can also be serviced with toll revenues.  The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance, including loans, to leverage nonfedera l funding, which may include investment from the private sector. Under the FAST Act, TIFIA is authorized to spend $1.44 billion over five years to cover the federal government’s cost of providing the subsidized credit. Each $1 of budget authority can suppo rt approximately $10 in loans. TIFIA requires that each proposed project have a dedicated revenue stream to repay the loan. For highway projects, toll revenues are the most commonly proposed revenue source. 35 Ibid. 36 Future Options for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways: Task 10 Final Report , Transportation Research Board (Washington, DC), NCHRP Project 20 -24 (52), pp. 13, 21, http://transportationfortomorrow.com/"

The creation of a well - funded National Infrastructure Bank could thus lead to an expansion of toll roads.37 Any expansion of tolling due to increased use of innovative f inancing for highway construction, maintenance, and operation would occur over an extended period of time. In any event, toll - supported innovative financing is likely to provide only a small proportion of highway spending needs unless Congress requires its use in large -scale reconstruction of Interstate highways.38 Tolling Policy Issues How Could an Interstate System Conversion Be Accomplished? The current federal -aid highway program is essentially a state -run federal grant program, and states own the federa l-aid highways within their borders."
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," Any immediate conversion of highways to toll roads would necessarily be at individual states’ discretion, with federal participation limited to technical assistance and a suggested conversion schedule. This would likely lead to a piecemeal outcome, as some states might convert quickly, some slowly, and some not at all. Congress could insist on a much stronger federal role by making the provision of federal highway grants to a state contingent on the state implementing a program of converting Interstate highways to toll roads. FHWA might then take the lead in determining the sequence of reconstruction and conversion of Interstate highways. This approach would have the advantage of assuring that all states would begin impos ing tolls at roughly the same time, and federal leadership would likely not allow the outbreak of “toll wars” among the states, whereby states attempt to impose toll rates in a way that shifts the burden of the toll to their neighbors or interstate travele rs generally. Under federal"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," oversight, the operation of the converted highways might still be under the auspices of the states, which could operate them directly, through a toll authority, or perhaps under contract to a private operator. Whether or not imp lementation of tolls were linked to reconstruction of existing roads, creation of tolling systems would require up -front investments in gantries, equipment to read transponders in vehicles, communications infrastructure, software to process toll payments, and enforcement. This would have to be done before the tolls are collected. How Would Tolls Be Regulated? A major increase in the extent of toll facilities or a decision to convert the Interstate System to toll roads would likely b ring calls for greater federal involvement in the regulation of tolling rates and strategies. Deeper federal involvement might include federal standards for tolls or a more precise definition of the requirement in current law that tolls be “just and reasonable,” along with provision for the enforcement"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," of that requirement. In such a case, Congress would need to clarify which federal agency would be responsible for enforcing tolling regulations and overseeing toll rates. 37 CRS Report R43308, Infrastructure Finance and Debt to Support Surface Transportation Investment , by William J.

Commerce Clause Issues in the Courts41 With the advent of electronic tolling and computerized charging and collection, toll operators have the capability of electronically distinguish ing among users by their residences and charg ing varying toll rates accordingly . However, such a course of action could create legal complications, including questions about whether variations in toll schedules based on residence violate a constitutional principle known as the “dormant Commerce Clause.”42 The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the various states.43 Congress has reli ed on this power as the constitutional basis for a notable portion of the laws passed over the last 80 years, and the Commerce Clause provides a broad basis for the exercise of"

Although the meaning and application of the dormant Commerce Clause has varied over time, the modern standard, as applied to fees levied by states , is effectively a three -pronged inquiry.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island applied the three -part test and upheld the toll schedule. The court noted that “in order to st ate a claim for discrimination in violation of the Commerce Clause, a plaintiff must identify an in -state commercial interest that is favored, directly or indirectly, by the challenged statutes at the expense of out -of-state competitors.”48 Here, the court found that “Plaintiff ... failed to identify a specific in -state commercial interest that is favored by the Newport Bridge toll discount at the expense of particular out -of-state competitors, so it cannot"

As a result, the court concluded the schedul e did not run afoul of the Commerce Clause.50 Similarly, in Yerger v . Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ,51 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard an appeal of a challenge to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority’s Fast Lane Discount Program. Th e program offered discounted toll fares to users of Massachusett s’s Fast Lane electronic toll payment system, but not to users of the multistate E -ZPass electronic toll payment system. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the different toll str uctures violated the dormant Commerce Clause. The court held that the toll structure was not discriminatory on its face, as the Fast Lane system was available to out -of-state drivers as well as"

As the Supreme Court has noted, “[w]here state or local government action is specifically authorized by Congress, it is not subject to the Commer ce Clause even if it interferes with interstate commerce.”58 Emerging Issues Some s tates may be tempted to collect tolls at state borders rather than at internal locations where more residents would be affected, effectively taxing interstate travel at high er rates than in -state travel and in some cases putting out -of-state companies at a competitive disadvantage against local companies. State legislation has also proposed giving state residents and businesses tax credits to offset the costs of tolls for state residents as a substitute for imposing border tolls .59 A related emerging issue relates to whether a state’s tolling of trucks engaged in the interstate movement of freight is an undue burden on interstate business.60 Tolling out"

Also , using commercial heavy truck tolls alone to fund toll facilities that are used by both heavy trucks and other motor vehicles could lead to dormant Commerce C lause challenges. Charging Truck s Commercial t ruck tolls are invariably higher than auto tolls, sometimes much higher: crossing the George Washington Bridge from New Jersey to New York at an off -peak hour costs $10.50 for a car with an electronic transponder, but $68.00 for a standard tractor -trailer rig. Truck tolls are set higher because the wear and tear caused by a heavy truck is much greater than that caused by most other vehicles. Trucking interests generally prefer higher fuels ta xes, whose revenues are dedicated to highway improvement, to higher tolls.61 Studies have concluded that funding highways with motor fuels taxes provides trucks a cross -subsidy from automobile users’ gas tax payments.62"

1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," through fuels taxes and other highway taxes , adding a toll would in effect be “double taxation.” Technology may help alleviate this concern, as electronic tolling facilities could credit each user for the estimated cost of motor fuel s taxes and other taxes by subtracting the estimated taxes from the toll paid. This would , however, lower toll revenue unless the toll rates are adjusted upward to compensate for the rebate. Another possibility would be to reimburse drivers for fuels taxes paid during toll road use via rebates on their tax returns. For taxpayers who file returns with the Internal Revenue Service , this could be done electronically. However , not all users file tax returns , leaving the question of how to protect these users from being charged both tolls and taxes for mileage driven on toll roads. The cost of the rebates to the U.S. Treasury could be subtracted from the HTF. If not, the rebates could be seen as a general fund subsidy to the HTF. Will Tolling Increase Transportation Spending?"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," Proponents often advocate tolling as a means of increasing total spending on surface transportation infrastructure. It is possible, however, that any increase in toll revenue could be offset by a decline in other revenues spent on surface transportation at the local, state, and federal levels. Congress has at times sought to condition federal support for states’ highway spending on “maintenance of effort” by state governments. Imposing similar requirements in conjunction with a large increase in the use of tolling would require increased federal monitoring of state and local transportation expenditures. Toll Credits An existing federal program, the toll credit program, has for many years allowed states to count expenditures of toll revenues on capital investments serving interstate travel as part of a state’s required match for federal highway grants.65 Although the statute states that the credit “shall not reduce nor replace State funds required to match Federal funds for any program under this title,” some"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," states have come to rely heavily on toll credits to meet their matching share requirements . A major expansion of Interstate highway tolling could also expand the use of toll credits 63 Linda Chiem, “Truckers Take NY Thruway Tolls Fight to 2nd Circ.,” Law360 , March 14, 2 017, https://www.law360.com/ articles/ 901865 . 64 The 2016 Rhode Island Law, known as RhodeWorks (2016 -S-2246), allows the Rhode Island Department of Transportation to establish and electronically collect tolls on heavy trucks crossing reconstructed National Highway System bridges in Rhode Island. Tolls on other vehicles are prohibited. Separately, in -state trucking companies and shippers are eligible for offsetting tax credits or rebates. 65 See 23 U.S.C. §120(A). In general, states must pay 20% of the cost of highway projects built with federal funds distributed by formula, except that the required match is 10% for Interstate highway projects. There are certain types of projects that do not require a state match. Tolling U.S. Highways"

This raises the possibility that states could provide les s state revenue funding for their matching shares of federal formula grants, unless other changes are made in the law. FHWA is charged with monitoring state spending to ensure that states maintain their efforts to improve the highway system. However, a 201 2 Government Accountability Office report found that FHWA ’s responsibility for determining whether a state could receive toll credits placed the agency “ in a position of approving actions it was actively and closely involved in developing.” 66 Vehicle Mile s Traveled Charges as an Alternative to Tolls A vehicle miles traveled ( VMT ) charge would be a toll -like charge on each mile driven. It has been advanced as an alternative to the federal and state motor fuels taxes that now support highway spending. As gen erally proposed, a mileage -based charge would be imposed for the use of any road within a state or nationwide, whereas tolls are"
1488bfc2-8812-4da4-8b88-345f2401546c," imposed only on specific highway segments , bridges, or tunnels . Most existing highway tolls are based on wei ght and distance tr aveled, and VMTs could be structured in a similar manner. Both electronic tolls and mileage -based road user charges could be used to implement congestion pricing, in which drivers are charged more for using a road at a busy time. However, a number of widel y criticized aspects of VMTs , such as the difficulty of accommodating drivers who lack credit card accounts to which the charges could be billed and concerns that the vehicle tracking system would invade drivers’ privacy, have generally been less prominent in discussions of tolling.67 Author Contact Information Robert S.

That is why the FHWA’s tolling and pricing team is available 30 n TOLLWAYS / SUMMER 2012to help select the best program for each project with the submission of an initial expression of interest. Un - derstand what you are trying to get out of your tolling project before you go too far down one program path. Missouri’s I-70 represented an excellent candidate for the program. It is located in the heartland of the country and connects with major north-south Interstates in both Kansas City and St. Louis; heavy truck traffic on I-70 has continued to grow and is anticipated to more than double by 2030. As one of the first segments of the Interstate Highway System (IHS) to be built in the 1950s, it’s never"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," been recon - structed. MoDOT makes continu - ous major reinvestments just to maintain the highway, and at this point in its lifecycle, the pavement — and aggregate underneath — has reached the end of its useful life. The bottom line: an entirely new facility is needed, one with at least one more lane in both directions. Depending on the improvement concept selected, that will cost ap - proximately $3 billion to $4 billion, a price tag that would require MoDOT to shelve nearly all other sched - uled projects for a decade if funded through traditional means. 2. Tell your project’s story. MoDOT had the history and relevant data ready at its fingertips to demon - strate the need to reconstruct and expand the Interstate and effectively DELIVERING REAL SOLUTIONS n 31 convey why the I-70 project should be selected for the program. Data on the Interstate’s age, condition, intensity of use, other performance metrics, and key corridor issues were critical to describing the over - all need for the project. One possible"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," I-70 toll concept calls for freight movement within dedicated truck lanes. In fact, truck traffic on I-70 makes up nearly 30 percent of the daily traffic, is growing more than twice as fast as passenger traffic, and is projected to double by 2030. Dedicated truck lanes would be specifically used for qualifying trucks; are designed to handle the additional weight of the vehicles; are typically separated from other passenger vehicle traffic by barriers or grass medians; could have their own interchanges at locations that have heavy truck traffic with sepa - rate entrance and exit ramps; and could be used by all traffic during specific time periods for incident management, like lane closures for accidents or construction. Tolling with dedicated truck lanes offers the trucking industry — as well as the general traveling public — lots of efficiencies including enhanced safety, the potential to use longer/heavier truck loads, higher reliability (to ensure just- in-time delivery), more efficient movement of goods,"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," and reduced insurance costs. 3. Educate your customer . Tolling and pricing often are new concepts, and public outreach for these types of projects involves a greater focus on education than traditional roadway projects. It is critical the public un - derstands why the project cannot be paid for through other means, such as the fuel tax. Outreach efforts need to communicate the critical function that tolls play in providing corridor benefits, such as a sustain - able maintenance source, as well as information on how and by whom tolls will be collected. A major success factor for MoDOT has been the value provided by a robust public involvement program. It has facilitated the factoring of public input into the improvement strategy. One innovative and award- winning tool developed for this proj - ect was the online public meeting. It meaningfully and cost-effectively 32 n TOLLWAYS / SUMMER 2012engaged motorists, travelers, and other stakeholders across the cor - ridor. A 3-D video simulation and electronic"

Robust engagement also has been crucial with the trucking industry, convenience store operators, and petroleum marketers, due to the calls for freight movement within dedicated truck lanes. Several an - cillary studies focused on national trends, and the impacts of freight movements, both within the corri - dor itself as well as origin-destina - tion impacts in the Kansas City and St. Louis metropolitan areas. Throughout this process, DOT lead - ership has been engaged to ensure commitment to the corridor vision, and to regular and proactive coor - dination with FHWA throughout the application process. 4. Consider private sector involve - ment. With today’s limited transpor - tation funding, demonstrating you can bring private sector financing to the table to complete the proj - ect faster and cheaper is an added value. The private sector can be involved in Interstate tolling projects through a wide range of public-"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," private partnership (P3) project delivery mechanisms. You will need to evaluate the pros and cons of DELIVERING REAL SOLUTIONS n 33 different project governance and de - livery options to decide if public or private ownership of the proposed project is the best approach. MoDOT is actively weighing its options. 5. Secure your legislation. When a state, local, or private agency decides to move forward with tolling an Interstate, there are several leg - islative issues that may need to be addressed prior to implementation. Does your state have the neces - sary legislative approvals to toll? To issue bonds? Does your state allow public-private partnerships to take advantage of private sector involve - ment? The challenge at the state level to enable tolling is one of the key factors preventing MoDOT’s I-70 project from moving forward toward implementation. HNTB’s role as a trusted adviser to transportation agencies has pro - vided the firm with a unique oppor - tunity to observe how various states have"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," developed, or are developing, P3 legislation. From that vantage point, here are several best prac - tices for maximizing P3 value: • Keep the language simple. The best P3 authorizing legislation often is just a few paragraphs. • Establish best-value selection crite - ria. To ensure the preferred project is advanced, the sponsoring agency should be able to choose the right bid, which may not always be the lowest bid. • Ensure flexibility. Sponsors should be able to take advantage of different project types, concession lengths, and the option to perform cursory reviews of unsolicited bids. • Limit the barriers to contract execu - tion. The sponsoring agency should attain the appropriate departmen - tal/legislative authority to execute procurement without further legis - lative or governmental approval. • Include implementation enhance - ments, e.g., video tolling and collection enforcement provisions, to maximize revenue. 34 n TOLLWAYS / SUMMER 2012WITH TODAY’S LIMITED TRANSPORTATION FUNDING, DEMONSTRATING YOU"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," CAN BRING PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCING TO THE TABLE TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT FASTER AND CHEAPER IS AN ADDED VALUE. • Allow public-public, as well as public- private partnerships. Perform a detailed inspection of current legis - lation and either “clean it up” or add a statement that the statute super - sedes any conflict with existing law. • Permit co-mingling of federal, public, and private funds. The legislation should ensure maximum flexibility by enabling the partnership to use multiple funding sources to deliver a project; and owners can then enter into different forms of P3 contracts as applicable to each project2. 6. Understand how revenues can be used. Tolling should provide a dedicated operations and main - tenance revenue stream to keep the Interstate in good operating condition with the safe and reliable standard of care the traveling public expects …for the long term. In fact, as part of ISRRPP, revenues collected from the tolled interstate facility have restrictions on their use and cannot be used"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," “off-corridor.” It’s a major reason some applica - tions have been rejected. Toll revenues must be used for debt service, reasonable return on investment — if private industry financing is involved — and any costs necessary for keeping the facility in good condition: operations and maintenance, reconstruction and rehabilitation, as well as cor - ridor capacity expansion. Excess toll revenues cannot be used for general state funding or other transportation system needs. Additionally, Interstate maintenance funds may not be used on a facility for which tolls are being collected under this program. However, regular federal-aid highway funds may be used to fund improvements, in addition to the toll revenues collected. 7. Factor in NEPA. Your project will need to have successfully com - pleted the NEPA process before approvals can be granted within the program. The social, economic, and environmental impacts of toll financing the project also must be evaluated within NEPA. The pro - gram gives priority to those"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," projects that can demonstrate fewer impacts to the natural and manmade environment, which also helps streamline the environmental approval process and project schedule. And — if your project has DELIVERING REAL SOLUTIONS n 35already evaluated tolling and re - ceived NEPA approvals — you have jumped over one of the toughest and most time consuming hurdles for successful program approval. MoDOT initiated the I-70 tiered NEPA process in advance of the ISRRPP application process, which provided significant data for use in the application and demonstrated the state’s commitment to mov - ing the project forward quickly. For MoDOT, a tiered Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) was the key to demonstrating the value of dedicated truck lanes. 8. Develop a sound tolling plan. As part of the application process, a state must demonstrate it has a tolling plan for the corridor, including the proposed toll rates, toll collection points, plans for manual and/or electronic toll col - lection, and the findings"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," of the traf - fic and revenue analysis performed for the corridor. Within the applica - tion, the FHWA wants to ensure the tolling plan for the corridor is fair and equitable to the traveling public, local communities along the corridor and neighboring states, and that tolling will be evaluated within the NEPA process for the project. 9. Learn by example. Missouri, Virginia, and North Carolina have all been successful at achieving provisional program slots. Review - ing their applications, consulting with their staff, and understanding the feedback they received from the FHWA can help streamline and strengthen future state applica - tions. While all available slots in the program are filled today, future federal transportation reauthoriza - tion could enable additional slots within the program, or allow more flexibility to toll existing Interstate general-purpose capacity. 10.Be ready to compete. Missouri understood the need to put together a competitive application to suc - cessfully gain federal approval"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," to toll I-70. The program is competitive and very limited, and many states are vying for a slot. MoDOT had to demonstrate that its I-70 project best met the eligibility requirements and that a sound plan was in place to get the project done. Today, no state has successfully implemented their ISRRPP tolling project. It remains to be seen if Missouri, 36 n TOLLWAYS / SUMMER 2012DELIVERING REAL SOLUTIONS n 37North Carolina or Virginia will be the first in the nation to fully imple - ment existing general-capacity In - terstate tolling. That first successful project could change the way exist - ing Interstates are maintained and expanded for the next generation of Interstate travelers. Tolling existing, general-purpose Inter - state capacity can require a sea change in how state DOTs do business. When selecting the right project, other questions decision makers should ask include: • What can you do with “more”? Tolling an Interstate frees up limited federal Interstate maintenance funds and state program dollars"
a3817243-3640-455f-904c-b5b41c10de55," so they can be leveraged on other pri - ority projects throughout the state. Understand and articulate how these dollars could be leveraged. • Can you accelerate project delivery? With today’s limited funding and a resource-minded public, can you reconstruct and expand your aging Interstate infrastructure in any other way, while getting it done faster and cheaper? Understanding such solutions will provide value for today’s evolving infrastructure marketplace. — GRETCHEN IVY is HNTB Corporation’s project manager for the I-70 dedicated truck lanes project in Missouri and a firm wide resource for the Federal Highway Administration’s Inter - state System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program.

In this white paper, three of the most problematic areas: • Submitting a confident T&R report or a conservative one? Which is best and why? • Pros and cons of electronic toll collection versus manual collection. • Extending enforcement beyond the border — a new frontier. page 2 More near -border toll facilities in the future Residents of El Paso, Texas, or Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, are all too familiar with traffic congestion.

The gridlock is due, in part, to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has incr eased dramatically cross- border traffic : − Nearly 93 million personal vehicles entered the United States in 2011, 31.6 million from Canada and 61.2 million from Mexico, according to the BTS. − In 2011, goods valued at more than $1.06 trillion crossed the U. S. border in trade with the two countries – 15 percent higher than in 2010 and 44 percent higher than 2009. − Total trade between U.S., Canada and Mexico increased 12 percent in 2011 from 2010. − Among all modes, roads had the largest increase in shipment value, $69 billion, from 2010 to 2011. The increased trade is clogging ports of entry. In 2011, authorities in Laredo, Texas, the top road gateway with $117.3 billion in international road shipments, nearly doubled the number of lanes to 15 on the World Trade Bridge. Still, the wait to enter or exit the United States can be as long as six hours. Lack of traditional"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," funding is driving trend No question the need for more border crossings and expansion of near -border facilities is there, but the funding to pay for them is not. As cash- strapped state departments of transportation try to keep pace with demand, many are considering tolling as a so lution to funding the mobility -enhancing projects their constituents so desperately need. We can see this trend playing out on both borders: • In California, the San Diego Association of Governments is considering a new port of entry and four -lane state highway border crossing in Otay Mesa. • In El Paso, the Texas Department of Transportation is attempting to ease congestion by implementing, in phases, a 40 -mile toll system of managed lanes and new toll lanes along Loop 375 and Inters tate 10. • On the northern border, the cities of Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, are a step closer to building a New International Trade Crossing toll bridge. Troubleshooting the three biggest challenges public owners will face HNTB Corporation has"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," assisted with the development and operation of several near -border toll facilities, including: • The Maine Turnpike • The Detroit Windsor Tunnel • The South Bay Expressway (State Route 125) in San Diego • Border -crossing civil and traffic engineering at the Lake Champlain facilities in upstate New York From those experiences, we have identified three problematic areas in maximizing toll revenue on a near -border toll project: 1. Preparing a sound traffic and revenue study Forecasting the socioeconomic trends and fluctuations in transportation patterns and mode choices that will influence demand for a proposed near -border facility are enormously challenging. Public owners have access to U.S. Census Bureau data and other resources to he lp forecast those characteristics for U.S. motorists, but getting that data is only half of the battle for near -border facilities. Accessing similar information from the neighboring country is much more difficult, if not impossible. − Include reasonable a ssumptions . The"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," city or metropolitan planning organization will have models, containing information about traffic generated from the neighboring country, as well as future growth and development in the area. Whatever those assumptions are, apply tolling to them and plug them into the T&R report. Owners also should conduct sufficient sensitivity testing of the assumptions to better understand the dynamics of the transportation system over the course of the transportation investment. If defendable and reasona ble, these assumptions and sensitivity results will help to raise the confidence levels of rating agencies and investors. − Highlight historic trends . The typical investment - grade traffic and revenue report contains an origin and destination study. But rep orts for page 3 near -border facilities will need to go into much more detail about the makeup of users and the frequency of their trips. Owners should factor into their reports any historic trends of toll facilities in the same area. − Segment the business rules ."
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," The owner will have to provide extensive detail about its revenue capture strategy. For near- border facilities, this strategy is much more influential than for other toll facilities with more “predictable” users. The owner will need to draft strong busin ess rules for each type of user and detail how the agency will communicate and enforce those rules. − Seek best practices . Public owners will need to cite specific steps they will take to mitigate leakage from international users. Because a depth of know ledge does not exist on this topic for U.S. agencies, one best practice is to ask other owners with similar facilities for their policies, procedures, benchmark collection rates and demographic profiles. − Estimate conservative ly. A near -border facility cannot approach the financial market with an inflated or unrealistic revenue capture rate. Investors and rating agencies will not have faith in them or the overall soundness of the toll plan. To instill in the financial market the greatest confidence in a"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," pr oposed facility and its management, owners should be realistic and honest in their reporting of both the assumptions, sensitivities and anticipated results. 2. Determining the best toll collection method . Brick -and-mortar toll plazas and toll booths are viewed by some as the best collection method for near -border facilities because they act as natural deterrents to violators. However, traditional collection methods may not be practical in every situation. For example, if an owner is adding new capacity to an existing congested highway in a heavily developed urban area, the necessary right of way may not exist to accommodate the wider roads traditional toll plazas require. Or, the cash - strapped public owner may lack the financial resources necessary to pay the additional capital and operational costs of traditional toll plazas. In this situ ation, the public owner may be willing to trade a sizeable leakage rate for the higher traffic volumes, lower capital outlay, potentially reduced operating costs"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," and increased environmental friendliness of all- electronic tolling. Would video tolling, as a backup system to all-electronic tolling, help increase the revenue capture rates? It would increase domestic revenue capture, but it will not necessarily increase the capture rate of international customers. Unless the owner has a legal agreement of reciprocity with the neighboring country, video tolling’s usefulness stops at the border. U.S. toll agencies cannot access contact information of foreign nationals nor do they have the authority to enforce payment beyond their states’ borders. Today, no U.S . toll agency or department of transportation has such an agreement with Mexico or Canada. Such an unprecedented partnership would be classified as an international affair, requiring the involvement of multiple U.S. federal government agencies, local and f ederal agencies of the neighboring country and a significant investment of time and resources on the owner’s part. In the meantime, owners may want to consider"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," other proactive steps to curb or offset leakage, such as: − Launching an extensive communication s campaign in both English and the language of the international target audience. Stress the benefits of using the facility and being a toll tag customer. − Making the toll tags easy to purchase and replenish . Installing toll tag kiosks, either in popular retail chains frequented by international customers or in locations near ports of entry, is a smart option. − Permitting anonymous toll tag accounts . These tags could be purchased and refilled with cash by customers who do not have major cre dit cards, U.S. debit cards or U.S. bank accounts. − Integrating the toll tag with other transportation elements . Allow customers to use their toll tags to pay for parking at nearby airports, in city parking garages and at stadiums . − Giving away toll tags as a promotion . If a large percentage of the facility’s international users will be frequent customers, this could be an effective strategy to broaden distribution"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," and encourage compliance. − Offering shuttle service . If vehicle ownership is low among resi dents in the neighboring foreign city, the public owner might consider offering shuttle service on its toll route. The shuttle then page 4 − could link with other modes of transportation, such as buses, streetcars, light -rail, etc., to improve connectivity within the city. − Expediting U.S. entry of commercial traffic . Foster an agreement with U.S. border inspection facility managers to dedicate a lane exclusively for commercial vehicles with toll tags, offering those customers faster entry and exit and greater incentive for compliance. Inspection charges could be combined with toll rates, allowing customers to pay a single fee. − Increasing non -toll revenue , such as: o Selling advertising space on bridges or dynamic message signs. o Offering sponsorships of service plazas, toll holidays, motorist -assist vehicles and park -n- ride lots. o Leasing easements for cell phone towers and fiber optic cable lines,"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," which generate revenue and benefit the facility’s operat ions. o Offering retail sales at the facility, such as food, merchandise, etc. − Sharing development costs with adjacent communities, developers and corporations that will benefit from the toll facility. 3. Enforcing c ompliance across the border Identifying international violators and preventing them from accessing the toll facility is a tremendous challenge. Overcoming it will require public owners to think creatively and forge new partnerships with: − Local law enforc ement. Owners may want to consider stationing patrol vehicles equipped with license plate readers along the route. These readers can scan hundreds of plates at a time and compare them with a database of repeat violators. The legal actions an officer can take once he or she has stopped a vehicle depends on the facility’s business rules and state statutes. − The U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service. Perhaps these federal agencies could"
77390a2c-07e0-4c82-9ae4-7727880e5407," identify violators via their passports and collect outstanding toll violations on the spot before allowing the person to enter or exit the United States? − The foreign tolling counterpart or border patrol. Could these entities identify violators as they cross the border? As incentive, the U.S. public owner might consider offering the participating foreign agencies a percentage of each payment they collect. It should be noted , however, that such partnerships do not exist and would involve a highly complex , lengthy process, most likely involving both federal governments . Chances are the public owner would need to explore legislation that would allow it to flag repeat violators at the border and deny them entry if payment for past violations is not rendered. No dou bt cros s-border traffic is increasing. Tollin g can be part of the solution in addressing the need for enhanced mobility as long as public owners understand and prepare for the unique risks they will face. Additional Resources For more"
